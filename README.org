#+TITLE Fred Ross's computer configuration

This is a shared configuration to be used across a number of machines.
It is meant to be kept in a git repository, and its components synced
when changed. I finally broke down and spent the time to build this
because I was wasting time trying to use commands I had built on
another computer.

* Installation
Run setup.sh. It will link all the files into ~.
